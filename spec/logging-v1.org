* Logging/Traffic v1 (noise gating)

- Reduce UI noise:
  - Reasoning logs ("reasoning: begin-request open=t") are gated behind defcustom carriage-mode-reasoning-log-verbose (default: nil).
  - Only state transitions are logged by default: begin, first token, end.
- Transport logs:
  - carriage-transport-* functions emit concise begin/streaming/complete lines.
  - Adapters (gptel/echo) log request and chunk kinds to *carriage-traffic* buffer.
- Apply logs:
  - Begin per item (engine, op, path, bytes), exit (code, stdout/stderr sizes), pid and elapsed time.
- User messages:
  - Timeouts/aborts show a gentle message in interactive sessions.
  - Success summary is announced once per report via carriage-announce.el.

Addendum v1.2 — Traffic buffers, summaries, and file logging
- Per-buffer traffic buffers:
  - Each carriage-mode buffer gets its own traffic buffer named: "*carriage-traffic:<basename>*"
    where <basename> is the visited file name or buffer-name.
  - Transport adapters log structured sections to this buffer.
- Structured request logging:
  - Adapters must emit:
    - "==== BEGIN REQUEST (backend:model) ===="
    - "---- SYSTEM ----" (full system message, if present)
    - "---- PROMPT ----" (full prompt)
    - "---- CONTEXT FILES (content omitted) ----" (list only paths/names; no content)
    - "==== END REQUEST ===="
- Structured response summaries:
  - On completion/abort emit:
    - "==== BEGIN RESPONSE (summary) ===="
    - "---- HEAD ----" first N bytes (carriage-traffic-summary-head-bytes)
    - "…"
    - "---- TAIL ----" last M bytes (carriage-traffic-summary-tail-bytes)
    - "==== END RESPONSE (bytes=K) ===="
  - N and M are customizable; defaults: 4096 each.
- Capacity and trimming:
  - Traffic buffers are trimmed from the top when exceeding carriage-traffic-max-bytes (default ~1MiB).
- Optional file logging:
  - When carriage-traffic-log-to-file=t, all traffic lines are also appended to carriage-traffic.log
    (path customizable; relative paths resolved against the origin buffer's default-directory).
