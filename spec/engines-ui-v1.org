* Engines selection UI (mode-line and prompt)

- List of engines in UI:
  - Hide bare 'git' from choices to avoid ambiguity.
  - Show only:
    - git:in-place — Git apply engine (in-place)
    - git:wip      — Git apply engine (wip)
    - git:ephemeral— Git apply engine (ephemeral)
  - Other engines (e.g., emacs) show as "emacs — Emacs apply engine" without policy suffixes.

- Default selection:
  - If current engine=git, default prompt value must be "git:<policy>" to match combo entries.
  - Selecting a combo sets carriage-apply-engine='git and carriage-git-branch-policy to the chosen policy.

- Patch dispatch contract (v1):
  - :op 'patch must go via git engine. If a user selects 'emacs, patch dispatch returns MODE_E_DISPATCH.
  - Async apply path also forces git engine when plan contains any patch items (parity with sync).

- Tooltips:
  - [Engine] tooltip should include current branch policy when engine=git.
