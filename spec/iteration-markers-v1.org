* Iteration markers v1.1 (placement, reading, strictness)

- Goal: make last-iteration collection robust and intuitive regardless of Org heading structure.
- Marker form (inline, human-visible):
  - Exactly one line:
    #+CARRIAGE_ITERATION_ID: <hex-id>
  - Placement: a blank line, then the marker, then the LLM response (patch blocks).
    Rationale: visually ties the marker to the answer, not to the heading.
- Text properties:
  - Source of truth for strict collectors remains buffer text properties
    carriage-iteration-id on the begin_patch line(s) of blocks.
  - Writer: carriage-mark-last-iteration sets these properties for the region.

Reading and selection rules:
1) The preferred source of truth is the text property 'carriage-iteration-id on the
   #+begin_patch line; when present, only such blocks are selected.
2) If no properties are set but an inline marker \"#+CARRIAGE_ITERATION_ID: <id>\" exists,
   the last such marker in the buffer defines the region of the last iteration:
   all blocks from the line after the marker up to the next marker below (or end of buffer)
   are selected.
3) Fallback: global #+PROPERTY: CARRIAGE_ITERATION_ID ... (legacy) for reading the id value.
4) As a last resort, when neither properties nor inline markers exist, the strict collector
   returns nil with a diagnostic hint to mark the region (carriage-mark-last-iteration).

Implementation note: The strict collector must fall back to the inline-marker rule (2) when no text properties are present. It should select all begin_patch blocks from the line after the last "#+CARRIAGE_ITERATION_ID: <id>" up to the next such marker below (or end of buffer). This makes C-c e A work even after reopening files or after manual insertion of blocks.

Writing:
- When streaming finalizes and mark-last-iteration=t, insert the inline marker if missing:
  blank line + "#+CARRIAGE_ITERATION_ID: <id>"
- Avoid duplicate markers by checking the preceding lines.

Compatibility:
- PROPERTY remains accepted but is discouraged visually; text properties are authoritative for strict apply.

Open tasks:
- Write/ship carriage-iteration-read-id and ensure carriage-stream-finalize inserts inline marker when requested.
- Improve strict diagnostics with counts and a one-liner hint to mark region.
