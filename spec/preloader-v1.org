* Streaming preloader v1

- Purpose: provide immediate visual feedback at insertion point before first token arrives.
- Mechanics:
  - On carriage-transport-begin, start a local buffer overlay spinner at insertion point.
  - Stop spinner on first streaming token (carriage-transport-streaming) or on complete.
- Customization:
  - carriage-mode-preloader-enabled (t/nil)
  - carriage-mode-preloader-interval (ms)
  - Frameset: unicode and ascii variants (configurable).
- Safety:
  - Buffer-local overlay/timer; cleaned on finalize or mode disable.
- Separation:
  - Preloader is distinct from reasoning block; it leaves no residual text in the buffer.
